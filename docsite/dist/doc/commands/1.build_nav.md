# Build the navigation tree

The navigation tree is built by running the global command `docnav` or locally in the template
the alias `wdoc`. This will parse the docs folder and build the json navigation tree from it

```bash
yarn wdoc
# or
npm run wdoc
```

You will need to run this command again if you add, remove or move elements
in the docs folder for the changes to be applied in the navigation tree
