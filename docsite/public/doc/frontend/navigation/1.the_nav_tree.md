# The navigation tree

The documentation website is organized from the `public/doc` folder. The `docnav` npm command will
process the docs folder and create a `nav.json` file at the root. This file will be used in the
website for auto navigation and routing.

## The docs directory

It is possible to use markdown documents, autogenerated docstrings and Vuejs components

```bash
:~/mylib/docsite/public/doc$ tree
├── get_started
│   ├── 1.install.md
│   ├── 2.usage.md
│   └── 3.examples.cmp
├── api
│   └── docstrings.json  # this file is generated from docstrings
└── nav.json # this file is autogenerated
```

A directory can contain these files and extensions to be processed for the nav:

- <kbd>docstrings.json</kbd> file: the parsed docstrings. See the Python api on how to generate
- <kbd>.md</kbd>: plain markdown files with code syntax highlight
- <kbd>.cmp</kbd>: Vuejs components. A component can be declared here for navigation with the
.cmp extension: just use an empty file. It will refer to a real `.vue` component 
defined in `src/pages/**`

The documents should use this naming sheme: `number.name.extension`. The
numbers are used to manage the order in the navigation widgets

## Build the nav file

Run the `docnav` command from the [@docdundee/docnav](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@docdundee/docnav)
package to build the `nav.json` file. A shortcut is available in the template site:

```bash
yarn wdoc
# or
npm run wdoc
```

Or run directly if you have it installed globally:

```bash
yarn docnav
# or
npm run docnav
```

Run this command from the root of the docsite
