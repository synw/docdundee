# Types linking

To improve the docstrings pages the nav tree builder command is capable of linking some types declared 
in a `type_urls.json` file at the root of the docs folder. Declare your types and their documentation urls here

```json
{
  "typescript": {
    "MyInterface1": "/frontend/interfaces/MyInterface1",
    "MyInterface2": "/frontend/interfaces/MyInterface2"
  },
  "python": {
    "MyType1": "/python/types/MyType1",
    "MyType2": "/python/types/MyType2",
    "HttpResponse": "https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/request-response/#httpresponse-objects",
    "HttpRequest": "https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/request-response/#httprequest-objects"
  }
}
```

When the parser encounters a declared type it will transform it into an internal link for relative urls, or
into external links that opens in a new tab for absolute urls
