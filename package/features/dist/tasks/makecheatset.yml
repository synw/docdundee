description: Create a cheatset for a library from code and doc
prompt: |-
    Read the input documents to create a rich, informative documentation cheatset. Retain 
    as much techinical details as possible like data structures, types and methods. Remember to
    always include short code examples to show how to use it. The target audience is an AI: try to
    compress the information as much as you can.

    Goal: another language model reading your cheatset should have a good understanding of 
    how the library works. To analyze the provided codebase break down the structure and functionality of 
    the modules and components. Think carefuly before writing your final cheatset. 
      
    I have a library called {name} with this code and documentation:

    ```
    {prompt}
    ```

    Important: output only the cheatset, avoid commenting. {instructions}
